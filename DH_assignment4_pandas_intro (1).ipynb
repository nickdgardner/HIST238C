    "## Tutorial: Intro to Dataframes in Pandas\n",
    "In this notebook we'll run through some basic examples of what you can do in pandas. If you are new to programming parts will probably seem overwhelming, but that's ok! Just absorb as much as you can in a reasonable amount of time, and make a note of things you find confusing. One of the best ways to learn programming is to dive right into the \"deep end\", using real tools to do something you're interested in, with real data. We are not going to be evaluating you on your \"coding skills\" in any way, and our hope is that you just enjoy the process of learning.\n",

A basic tutorial on pandas by Chris Potts from Stanford's Programming for Linguists class ([html version](http://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist278/notes/ling278_class12.html), [jupyter notebook version](http://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist278/notes/ling278_class12.ipynb)). Most of the tutorial below is adapted from this.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [10 minutes to pandas](http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/getting_started/10min.html). Note that despite it's friendly title this takes longer than 10 minutes, and is geared mainly toward people with some programming experience (though it's still possible to learn from it if you are new!).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [pandas User Guide](http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/user_guide/index.html), helpfully organized by topic.\n",
    "\n",

    "As you go through the tutorial it may also be helpful to have the data uploaded in a google sheets page so that you can manually scroll around in it and compare with what the pandas operations do.\n"
